# Client Email Tone Guidelines

Apply these rules automatically whenever drafting, editing, or reviewing any email intended for a client.

## Structure

Every client email must follow this structure, in order:

1. **Salutation** — `Dear [First Name],`
2. **Opening sentence** — warm, purposeful, no filler phrases (e.g. avoid "I hope this email finds you well")
3. **Body** — clear, conversational paragraphs (see Tone rules below)
4. **Closing line** — a single, forward-looking sentence summarising next steps or expressing availability
5. **Sign-off** — `Kind regards,` followed by `[Your Name]` and title on the next line
6. **Disclaimer** — standard disclaimer block (see below), separated by a horizontal rule

## Tone Rules

- Write conversationally but professionally — as if speaking to a trusted client face-to-face
- Use plain English; avoid financial jargon unless the client has demonstrated familiarity with the term
- Keep sentences short. One idea per sentence where possible
- Use active voice: "I have reviewed your portfolio" not "Your portfolio has been reviewed"
- Address the client by first name within the body if it reads naturally (once is enough)
- Never use urgency or sales language — see Prohibited Language below

## Prohibited Language

Never use any of the following in client emails:

| Avoid | Use instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Act now" | "When you're ready to proceed…" |
| "Don't miss out" | (omit entirely) |
| "Limited time offer" | (omit entirely) |
| "Guaranteed returns" | "potential returns, which are not guaranteed" |
| "You must" | "We would suggest…" or "It may be worth considering…" |
| "Exciting opportunity" | "An option that may suit your goals…" |
| "As soon as possible" | "At your earliest convenience" |
| "Urgent" | (rephrase to describe the actual deadline or consequence) |

## Salutation and Sign-off Format

**Opening:**
```
Dear [First Name],
```

**Closing:**
```
Kind regards,

[Your Name]
[Job Title]
[Firm Name]
[Phone Number]
```

## Standard Disclaimer

Always append the following disclaimer at the end of every client email, separated from the sign-off by a horizontal rule:

```
---
This email contains general information only and does not take into account your personal
financial situation, objectives, or needs. It does not constitute financial advice. Before
making any financial decisions, please consider whether this information is appropriate for
your circumstances and consult a licensed financial adviser. Past performance is not a
reliable indicator of future performance.
```

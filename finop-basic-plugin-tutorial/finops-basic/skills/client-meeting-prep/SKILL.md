# Client Meeting Preparation

When preparing for a client meeting, always follow these steps in order:

## 1. Client Context
- Review any notes or documents about the client provided in the conversation
- Identify their key financial goals, risk profile, and current portfolio focus
- Note any open action items from previous meetings

## 2. Meeting Agenda Structure
Always suggest a structured agenda:
1. Relationship check-in (5 min)
2. Portfolio performance review (10 min)
3. Market updates relevant to their holdings (10 min)
4. New recommendations or actions (15 min)
5. Next steps and follow-up items (5 min)

## 3. Talking Points
Prepare 3-5 concise talking points tailored to:
- Current market conditions relevant to the client's sector exposure
- Any life events or circumstances they've mentioned
- Upcoming regulatory or tax deadlines

## 4. Output Format
Always produce:
- A one-page briefing document
- A bullet-point agenda the advisor can print
- A list of questions to ask the client

## Tone
- Professional but warm
- Use plain English, avoid jargon unless the client is sophisticated
- Always frame recommendations in terms of the client's stated goals

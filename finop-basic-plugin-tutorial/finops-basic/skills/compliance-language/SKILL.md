# Compliance Language Guidelines

## Always Include
- Appropriate disclaimers when discussing investment performance
- "Past performance is not indicative of future results" when referencing historical returns
- "This information is general in nature and does not constitute financial advice" on general communications

## Never Include
- Guaranteed return language (e.g., "you will earn", "guaranteed growth")
- Comparisons to specific competitor products by name
- Specific predictions about market movements stated as fact

## Required Disclosures by Communication Type

### Client Emails
Add at the bottom:
> This email contains general information only and does not take into account your personal financial situation. Please consult a licensed financial adviser before making any investment decisions.

### Performance Reports
Add at the top:
> Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. All figures are in AUD unless otherwise stated.

### Product Recommendations
Add inline before the recommendation:
> The following information is provided for educational purposes. Please review the relevant Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) before investing.

## Tone Rules
- Use "may" and "could" instead of "will" and "shall" for forward-looking statements
- Replace "best" with "suitable" or "appropriate for your situation"
- Avoid superlatives in investment contexts

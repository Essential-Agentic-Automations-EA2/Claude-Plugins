The starter tutorial: build a **Financial Services Plugin** from scratch using natural language and Markdown files.

| File/Folder | What it is |
|---|---|

| [lab-guide.md](./finop-basic-plugin-tutorial/lab-guide.md) | Step-by-step instructions for building your plugin |
| [finops-basic/](./finop-basic-plugin-tutorial/finops-basic/) | The starter plugin files you'll work from |
